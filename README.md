Otto
====

Text goes here...link to blog post with introduction. It's easiest to understand Otto by trying it out...

Otto is tested with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with Puppet 2.7.19.

Getting started: deploying `helloworld`
---------------------------------------

`helloworld` is a simple application deployable with Otto. `helloworld` is a Java application that reads configuration, logs several messages, and then exits after 30 seconds (simulating an application crash.)

To deploy the application, Otto will:

1. Create an unprivileged user, `helloworld` (`examples/helloworld/modules/helloworld/manifests/init.pp`)
2. Install the Java 7 runtime, `openjdk-7-jre` (`examples/helloworld/modules/java/manifests/init.pp`)
2. Create the `/opt/otto` hierarchy (`modules/otto/manifests/init.pp`)
3. Install [daemontools](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html), a collection of tools for managing services
4. Ensure that the daemontools [service scanner](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/svscan.html) is running
5. Download the `helloworld` build artifact from the (simulated, Jenkins-like) build server (`examples/helloworld/modules/otto_java_app_from_jenkins/manifests/init.pp`)
6. Deploy the `helloworld` configuration files (`examples/helloworld/files/conf`)
7. Run the application (`examples/helloworld/templates/run.erb`)
8. Ensure that the service is [started at boot and automatically restarted if it fails](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/faq/create.html#why)

Running the example will make (reversible) changes to your system state, so consider using a virtual machine. To deploy `helloworld`, run:

    sudo puppet apply --modulepath modules:examples/helloworld/modules --debug examples/helloworld/manifests/site.pp

`helloworld` will be installed into `/opt/otto` and started automatically.

Try a few experiments to understand Otto:

* Run `svstat /etc/service/helloworld` to show the application's PID
* Run `svc -t /etc/service/helloworld` to send SIGTERM to the application; it will automatically restart
* Restart the machine; `hellloworld` will automatically start
* View the application logs in `/opt/otto/data/helloworld/log`. Observe that the application is frequently (simulating) crashing and being automatically restarted.
* Run `pstree -paul` to show the process hierarchy. Observe that `java` is running as the unprivileged `helloworld` user.
* Examine `/opt/otto/service/helloworld/run` and `/opt/otto/run/helloworld` to understand how Otto invokes `helloworld`. Note that the logging configuration in `examples/helloworld/modules/helloworld/files/conf/logback.xml` uses an environment variable supplied by Otto to locate the application data directory.

Next, try changing the application configuration. After making a change, rerun `puppet apply`; Otto will restart the application with its new configuration.

* Deploy a different build (`1`, `2` or `3`) by changing `jenkinsBuildID` in `examples/helloworld/manifests/site.pp` and then rerunning `puppet apply`. Otto will download the new build, stop the existing build, and then start the new build. Try rolling back to a previous build; Otto will avoid redownloading a build it has already retrieved.
* Change the log level in `examples/helloworld/modules/helloworld/files/conf/logback.xml` or a configuration value in `examples/helloworld/modules/files/conf/application.conf`
* Change `value2` in `examples/helloworld/manifests/site.pp`
* Change `value3` in `examples/helloworld/modules/templates/run.erb` by changing the amount of swap space on the machine (`dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=65536; mkswap /swapfile; swapon /swapfile`)

Next steps
----------

Now that you've seen a working example, try deploying your own application with Otto. Be sure to follow the application notes in `modules/otto/manifests/{app,init}.pp`.

Known issues
------------

Otto does not provide a mechanism for removing deployed applications, but it's [easy to do manually](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/faq/create.html#remove).
